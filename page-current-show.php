				<h1>10 x 10 @ 1708 Gallery</h1>
				<hr />
				<p>Community Room is thrilled to have been selected to be a part of 1708 Gallery's 2015 summer series, 10 x 10 - Richmond Takes the Gallery.</p>
				<p>From June 2 – August 9, 2015, 1708 will open its doors to 10 artists and community organizations. Each of these individuals or groups will occupy the gallery for one week, for a total of 10 weeks.</p>
				<p>Inspired by a program at Nurture Art, New York, 10 x 10 is an experiment—an open platform that treats the gallery as a communal space. Artists and organizations will use the time and the space to try something different, to test an idea, to experiment with a project, and to engage with new audiences. Across these 10 projects, a picture of the originality and quirkiness, intelligence and ambition, and overall creativity of Richmond’s community will be highlighted.</p>
